My main configuration and support for ZMK for the Cardinal keyboard.

Prone to weird things, personal configs are always weird.

There are plans to have 2 branches:
-  Main: Main config, prone to experiments on .keymap, full support for future ZMK versions, ZMK Studio and [Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/).
-  Version-Pin: "Legazy" version, pinned on ZMK V0.3.0, support for Keymap Editor but no ZMK Studio, could implement it, but preffer to leave it alone (for now).
